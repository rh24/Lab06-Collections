# Collections

This is a .NET Core Console Application written in C# that serves as a way to practice using enums and collections. Within the repository, there are two custom classes: a generic class Deck<T> and a Card class. Within the program, new instances of the generic Deck<T> class may be instantiated. It implements the IEnumerable interface in order to make the deck instnace an iterable collection of items.

Collections are useful because they are dynamic in size. They are another way for us to group related objects, except unlike arrays, they are not fixed lengths. The System.Collections.Generic namespace provides many useful pre-built collections that enforce type-safety, and generally, we are only to create a custom collection if absolutely necessary. Here, is to practice and comb through the underlying code that it takes to create an enumerable collection, to add, and to remove from it.
